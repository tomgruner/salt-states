Salt States in development for Ubuntu 

I use the states with Vagrant and Salty Vagrant locally

After installing Virtualbox, Vagrant, and Salty Vagrant on your dev machine 
run "vagrant up" in the root of this repository
then ssh into the virtual machine with "vagrant ssh"

After that run salt by using "sudo salt-call state.highstate" inside the virtual machine
