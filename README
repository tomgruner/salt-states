Salt States in development for Ubuntu 


I use the states with Vagrant and Salty Vagrant locally

1) Install Virtualbox, Vagrant, and Salty Vagrant on your dev machine 
2) run "vagrant up" in the root of this repository
3) ssh into the virtual machine with "vagrant ssh"
4) Add in your custom pillar data in a directory called "pillar"
5) Run salt by using "sudo salt-call state.highstate" inside the virtual machine
