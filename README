Salt States in development for Ubuntu Server


I use the states with Vagrant and Salty Vagrant locally

1) Install Virtualbox, Vagrant, and Salty Vagrant on your dev machine 
2) Add in your custom pillar data in a directory called "pillar" located in the root of this repository
3) run "vagrant up" in the root of this repository
4) ssh into the virtual machine with "vagrant ssh"
5) Run salt by using "sudo salt-call state.highstate" inside the virtual machine
