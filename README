Salt States in development for Ubuntu Server


I use the states with Vagrant and Salty Vagrant locally

Quick Start:

1) Install Virtualbox, Vagrant, and Salty Vagrant on your dev machine 
2) Add in your custom pillar data in the 'pillar' directory
3) Copy your private key to /salt/deploy/id_rsa  
4) run "vagrant up" in the root of this repository
5) ssh into the virtual machine with "vagrant ssh"
6) Run salt by using "sudo salt-call state.highstate" inside the virtual machine


Useful commands:


Check out the pillar data:
sudo salt-call pillar.data django_projects
sudo salt-call pillar.data ssh
sudo salt-call pillar.data postgresql

Run salt highstate:
sudo salt-call state.highstate

Run a single state file:
sudo salt-call state.sls ssh
